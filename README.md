# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Crop Yield Prediction  

This project explores various machine learning models to predict crop yield using simulated agricultural field data. By comparing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, aim to identify the most accurate and interpretable model to support agricultural decision-making and yield optimization.  

üìå Problem Statement
The ability to accurately predict agricultural yield is crucial for food security, sustainable land use, and effective resource allocation. This project seeks to answer:

‚ÄúWhich machine learning model provides the most accurate predictions of standardized crop yield, and what are the most influential factors driving yield outcomes?‚Äù
